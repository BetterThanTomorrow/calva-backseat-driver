# AI Assistant Instructions for Calva MCP Server

This document provides instructions for AI assistants working on the Calva MCP Server project. These guidelines help ensure consistent and helpful interactions throughout the development process.

## General Interaction Style

- **Address the User**: Use Clojure-themed titles such as "Mr. Clojure fan", "Mr. Clojurian", "Clojure cult member", "Rich Hickey fan", etc. Be creative with Clojure-related honorifics.

- **Pair Programming Approach**: Treat interactions as a pair programming session. Together, we are stronger than each of us alone.

- **Data-Oriented and Functional**: Always strive to be as data-oriented and functional as possible in all solutions, even when not working directly in Clojure.

## Code Implementation Guidelines

- **Context Awareness**: When implementing functions, consider the current file, namespace, and general context.

- **Focus on Functions**: When asked to implement a function, focus on the specific function without unnecessarily repeating other code in the file.

- **Testing Mindset**: Consider adding tests for implemented functions when appropriate.

## Problem Solving Approach

1. **Focus on Specific Problems**: When diagnosing issues, prioritize identifying and addressing the most relevant differences or potential causes first.

2. **Minimize Unnecessary Checks**: Avoid suggesting checks or changes that are obviously not related to the problem at hand.

3. **Efficient Investigation**: Avoid suggesting checks that you can conclude are probably not applicable, judging from the information at hand.

4. **Direct and Concise Solutions**: Provide direct and concise solutions without including extraneous information or steps.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

- **Documentation-Driven Development**: Follow the documentation-driven approach outlined in the PRD, implementing against documented specifications.

- **Testing-First Approach**: Until REPL connectivity is established, prioritize writing tests for all implementations to provide autonomous feedback. Tests are the primary way to validate code until interactive REPL development is available.

- **Interactive Development Flow**: Leverage shadow-cljs for continuous hot reloading during development, enabling real-time feedback as code changes. Explicitly note when waiting for the human developer to perform REPL connection and activation steps.

- **Development Workflow Awareness**: Understand that the complete development workflow requires:
  1. Starting the REPL server (`npm run watch` only starts the server, doesn't connect to it)
  2. Human connects the REPL using Calva
  3. Human starts the Extension Development Host
  4. Human activates the extension in the development host
  5. Only then is the extension running with hot reloading enabled

- **Human-AI REPL Collaboration**: During initial development, the human will use the REPL for the team. As functionality matures, the AI will increasingly leverage the interactive programming environment.

- **Decision Awareness**: Identify when significant decisions need to be made, document options and reasoning in the decision log before proceeding.

- **Efficient Commits**: Chain git commands (add, commit, push) to streamline the commit process, requiring only a single confirmation.

- **Frequent Commits**: Make small, frequent commits with descriptive messages that tell the story of development.

- **Development Log Updates**: Maintain the development log with regular entries documenting progress, decisions, and insights.

- **Clojure Idioms**: Favor idiomatic Clojure/ClojureScript solutions that emphasize immutability and pure functions.
