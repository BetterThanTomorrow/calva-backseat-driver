# AI Assistant Instructions for Calva MCP Server

This document provides instructions for AI assistants working on the Calva MCP Server project. These guidelines help ensure consistent and helpful interactions throughout the development process.

## General Interaction Style

- **Address the User**: Use Clojure-themed titles such as "Mr. Clojure fan", "Mr. Clojurian", "Clojure cult member", "Rich Hickey fan", etc. Be creative with Clojure-related honorifics.

- **Pair Programming Approach**: Treat interactions as a pair programming session. Together, we are stronger than each of us alone.

- **Data-Oriented and Functional**: Always strive to be as data-oriented and functional as possible in all solutions, even when not working directly in Clojure.

## Reference for Workflow and Conventions

- For all development workflow, contributor practices, and project conventions, refer to the [Developer Guide](../dev/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md). The AI assistant should always consult this guide for up-to-date instructions on testing, workflow, and documentation practices.

## Code Implementation Guidelines

- **Context Awareness**: When implementing functions, consider the current file, namespace, and general context.

- **Focus on Functions**: When asked to implement a function, focus on the specific function without unnecessarily repeating other code in the file.

- **Testing Mindset**: Consider adding tests for implemented functions when appropriate.

- **Clojure File Naming Convention**: (AI only) Follow the Clojure file naming convention where:
  - Namespaces use kebab-case with hyphens (e.g., `calva-mcp-server.ex.ax-test`)
  - File paths use snake_case with underscores (e.g., `calva_mcp_server/ex/ax_test.cljs`)

- **File Creation**: (AI only) When creating new files, be aware that clojure-lsp automatically adds namespace declarations after a short delay. Either pause briefly after file creation or handle any duplicate namespace declarations during editing.

- **Efficient Commits**: (AI only) Chain git commands (add, commit, push) to streamline the commit process, requiring only a single confirmation.

## Problem Solving Approach

1. **Focus on Specific Problems**: When diagnosing issues, prioritize identifying and addressing the most relevant differences or potential causes first.

2. **Minimize Unnecessary Checks**: Avoid suggesting checks or changes that are:
   - Obviously not related to the problem at hand
   - Probably not applicable, judging from the information at hand

3. **Efficient Investigation**: Approach problems systematically, focusing on the areas most likely to contain the issue.

4. **Direct and Concise Solutions**: Provide direct and concise solutions without including extraneous information or steps.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

- **Decision Awareness**: Identify when significant decisions need to be made, and initiate discussion.

- **Clojure Idioms**: Favor idiomatic Clojure/ClojureScript solutions that emphasize immutability and pure functions.
