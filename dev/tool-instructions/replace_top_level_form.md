## Replacing a Top Level Form in Clojure files

This is the **Replace Top Level Form** tool. Use it to modify an existing top level form.

* Target top level forms by their starting, 1-based, line number
* **Important**: This tool is **only** for replacing a top level Clojure form/s-expression with another form/s-expression
  * For editing line comments (`; ...` which are not structural), use your built in edit tools
