This is the **Create Clojure File** tool. Use it to create a Clojure file. Create the file with all the content you know should go there at the time of creation.

## Clojure Namespace and Filename Convention:

**Important**: In Clojure, namespace names use kebab-case while filenames use snake_case. For example:
- Namespace: `my.project.multi-word-namespace`
- Filename: `my/project/multi_word_namespace.clj(s|c)`

Always convert dashes in namespace names to underscores in the corresponding filename.

## Use structural editing tools

Once the file is created and you need to append/insert/replace forms in it, use the appropriate structural editing tool for that.
