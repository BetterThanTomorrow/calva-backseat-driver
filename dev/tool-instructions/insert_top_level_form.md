## Inserting Top Level Forms in Clojure Files

This is the **Insert Top Level Form** tool. Use it to insert new forms to a file, the forms will be inserted before an existing, targeted, top level form.

* Always target the top level of the code
* Use 1-based, line numbers
* **Important**: This tool is **only** for inserting Clojure forms/s-expressions, one at a time
  * For inserting line comments (`; ...` which are not structural), use your built in edit tool
