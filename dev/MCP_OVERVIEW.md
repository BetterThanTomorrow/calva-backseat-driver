# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

## What is Model Context Protocol?

MCP is a protocol that enables AI language models (like Claude, GPT, etc.) to interact with external tools and resources. It creates a standardized way for AI assistants to:

1. **Discover capabilities** provided by servers
2. **Call functions** (tools) that execute on those servers
3. **Access resources** like files or API responses
4. **Use templates** (prompts) for specialized tasks

## Client-Server Architecture

The MCP architecture consists of:

1. **MCP Hosts/Clients** (like Claude for Desktop, GitHub Copilot) - Interfaces between the user and the language model
2. **MCP Servers** - Expose tools, resources, and prompts to the language model
3. **Language Models** (like Claude, GPT) - Analyze problems and decide which tools to use

When a user asks a question:
- The client sends the question to the language model
- The model decides which tools it needs to answer the question
- The client executes those tools through the appropriate MCP server
- The results are sent back to the model
- The model formulates a natural response

## Types of Capabilities

MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:

1. **Resources**: File-like data that can be read by clients (API responses, file contents)
2. **Tools**: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)
3. **Prompts**: Pre-written templates that help accomplish specific tasks

## Calva MCP Server Implementation

For our Calva MCP Server project, we're building an MCP server that will expose Calva's capabilities (particularly REPL evaluation) to AI assistants. This means an AI will be able to:

1. Evaluate Clojure/ClojureScript code in a REPL
2. Get results back in a structured format
3. Use those results to help solve programming problems

This is powerful because it allows AI assistants to not just reason about Clojure code, but actually execute it and see the results - similar to how human developers use the REPL during development.

## Key Components for Implementation

Based on the MCP specification, our server will need:

1. **Tool Definitions**: We'll define tools like `evaluate-code` that expose Calva's REPL functionality
2. **Tool Execution Logic**: The actual implementation that connects to Calva's API
3. **Server Setup**: Code to initialize and run the MCP server
4. **Response Formatting**: Logic to format evaluation results in a way the LLM can understand

## ClojureScript Implementation Approach

Our implementation in ClojureScript will:

1. Use a ClojureScript library for implementing MCP servers (or create bindings to a JavaScript one)
2. Define our tools using this library
3. Connect these tools to Calva's extension API
4. Handle communication between the LLM and Calva

Since JavaScript/Node.js is a supported platform for MCP, and ClojureScript compiles to JavaScript, we can leverage the JavaScript ecosystem while maintaining the benefits of Clojure's functional approach.

## Benefits for Clojure Developers

By connecting AI assistants to a live REPL, we enable:

1. **Interactive Exploration**: AI can test hypotheses by executing code
2. **Data-Aware Assistance**: AI can analyze actual data structures, not just guess about them
3. **Runtime Insights**: AI can observe behavior at runtime, not just predict from static code
4. **REPL-Driven Development**: AI can participate in the same workflow Clojure developers love
