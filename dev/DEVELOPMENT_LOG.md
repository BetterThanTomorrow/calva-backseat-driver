# Calva MCP Server - Development Log

This document tracks the development progress of the Calva MCP Server extension. It serves as a historical record of decisions, challenges, and insights gained throughout the development process.

## 2024-04-13: Project Initialization

### Accomplishments
- Renamed extension from vsc-et template to calva-mcp-server
- Created directory structure for new namespace
- Updated package.json with appropriate metadata

- Ran end-to-end tests to confirm correct renaming
- Created Project Requirements Document (PRD)

### Decisions
- Decided to follow Documentation Driven Development approach
- Opted to implement REPL evaluation capabilities as the MVP
- Determined that a development log would complement the PRD

### Insights
- The extension template provides a solid foundation for extension development
- Maintaining a development log alongside the PRD helps track both the destination and the journey
- Documentation-first approach encourages thoughtful API design before implementation

### Next Steps
- Define detailed API specification based on Calva Extension API
- Research Model Context Protocol implementation details
- Set up basic server infrastructure
- Implement initial REPL evaluation functionality
